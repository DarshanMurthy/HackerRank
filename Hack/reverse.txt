Node next = tmp.next;
while(tmp != null){

So what happens when tmp == null?

You almost got it, though.

Node before = null;
Node tmp = head;
while (tmp != null) {
    Node next = tmp.next;
    tmp.next = before;
    before = tmp;
    tmp = next;
}
head = before;

Or in nicer (?) naming:

Node reversedPart = null;
Node current = head;
while (current != null) {
    Node next = current.next;
    current.next = reversedPart;
    reversedPart = current;
    current = next;
}
head = reversedPart;

ASCII art:

        <__<__<__ __ : reversedPart    : head
                 (__)__ __ __
head :   current:      >  >  >
